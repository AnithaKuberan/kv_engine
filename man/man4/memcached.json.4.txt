== NAME

memcached.json - memcached configuration file

== DESCRIPTION

*memcached.json* is a JSON encoded file specifying the properties
used to configure the memcached server. Some of the parameters
may be changed at runtime by instructing memcached to reread the
configuration file. These properties is explicitly marked as
such.

The following sections describes the various attributes that may
be specified.

=== admin

Specify the username used for administrive operations (like bucket
management). To disable the use of an administrative role you should
set this to an empty string.

=== rbac_file

Specify the filename containing all of the RBAC definitions

=== threads

The *threads* attribute specify the number of threads used to serve
clients. By default this number is set to 75% of the number of cores
available on the system (but no less than 4). The value for threads
should be specified as an integral number.

=== interfaces

The *interfaces* attribute is used to specify an array of interfaces
memcached should listen at. Each entry in the interfaces array is an
object describing a single interface with the following properties:

    host          A string value specifying the hostname to bind to.
                  If the attribute is missing (or set to "*")
                  IN_ADDR_ANY is used.

    port          An integral number specifying the port number

    IPv4          A boolean value specifying if IPv4 should be enabled
                  or not. By default IPv4 is enabled.

    IPv6          A boolean value specifying if IPv6 should be enabled
                  or not. By default IPv6 is enabled.

    maxconn       An integral number specifying the maximum number of
                  concurrent clients that may be connected.

    backlog       An integral number specifying the backlog size
                  set to listen.

    tcp_nodelay   A boolean value if TCP_NODELAY should be set or not.
                  By default tcp_nodelay is enabled.

    ssl           An object specifying SSL related properties.
                  See below.

The *ssl* object contains the two *mandatory* attributes:

    key           A string value with the absolute path to the
	          file containing the private key to use.

    cert          A string value with the absolute path to the
                  file containing the X.509 certificate to use.

*maxconn*, *backlog*, *tcp_nodelay*, *ssl.key* and *ssl.cert* may
be modified by instructing memcached to reread the configuration
file.

=== extensions

The *extensions* attribute is used to specify an array of extensions
which should be loaded. Each entry in the extensions array is an
object describing a single extension with the following attributes:

    module    A string value containing the module to load. This may
              either be an absolute path, or the systems library path
              will be searched for the object. When loaded memcached
              calls the method memcached_extensions_initialize().

    config    A string value containing configuration attributes to
              the module. The config value is passed transparently
              to the module.

=== engine

The *engine* attribute is used to specify the engine to load. It is
an object with the following attributes:

    module    A string value containing the module to load. This may
              either be an absolute path, or the systems library path
              will be searched for the object. The object must
              implement the engine api.

    config    A string value containing configuration attributes to
              the module. The config value is passed transparently
              to the module.

=== require_sasl

The *require_sasl* attribute specify if performing SASL authentication
is required or not. The value is a boolean value which is set to false
by default.

=== reqs_per_event

The *reqs_per_event* attribute is an integral value specifying the
number of request that may be served per client before serving
the next client (to avoid starvation). The default value is 20.

*reqs_per_event* may be updated by instructing memcached to reread
the configuration file.


=== verbosity

The *verbosity* attribute is an integral value specifying the amount
of output produced by the memcached server. By default this value is
set to 0 resulting in only warnings to be emitted. Setting this
value too high will produce a lot of output which is most likely
meaningless for most people.

*verbosity* may be updated by instructing memcached to reread
the configuration file.

=== datatype_support

The *datatype_support* attribute is a boolean value to enable the support
for using the datatype extension. By default this support is *disabled*.
